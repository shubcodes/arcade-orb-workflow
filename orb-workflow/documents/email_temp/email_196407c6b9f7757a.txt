Attachment: sales_order_1.txt (text/plain) - Downloaded Possibly Invoice
  Size: 76 bytes
  Saved to: /Users/shub/Documents/GitHub/arcade-orb-2/orb-workflow/documents/email_temp/attachments_196407c6b9f7757a/sales_order_1.txt
  Analysis: True, Confidence: 0.8
  Reason: The document contains information related to a business subscription, including a company name ('Another Corp Inc.'), an email address, a plan name ('Basic'), and the number of users (5). Although it lacks monetary amounts, due dates, and explicit terms like 'invoice' or 'bill', the presence of subscription details indicates it is likely related to billing or invoicing. The file name 'sales_order_1.txt' also suggests a business transaction context.
